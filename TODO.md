# TODO

- add `contributes/viewsWelcome` with a friendly configuration form
- add `ignoreFiles` or `files` pattern configuration to define in which files extension should be activated (by default for all?)
- make configuration validation on tokenizer-configuration class level
- allow results to be merged to file (low priority)

# Thoughts

- track if users would like to have an access to "update external token storage" trigger (e.g. if they have tokens on remote and want to update it by some custom logic)
- track reaction of users: should we put tokens to local store in case they were already in the external storage?
