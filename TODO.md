# TODO

- add View to display progress, info, action buttons
  - allow to copy token value (fast copy token value to insert in "provide token" dialog)
  - allow to sort columns (check if values are repeating)
  - allow to clear results (with a warning dialogue)
  - allow to generate results (should we clear results after?)
- make configuration validation on tokenizer-configuration class level
- allow results to be merged to file (low priority)
- track if users would like to have an access to "update external token storage" trigger (e.g. if they have tokens on remote and want to update it by some custom logic)
